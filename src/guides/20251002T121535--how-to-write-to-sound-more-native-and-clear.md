# Parameters

These rules make your writing sound more native and clear.

## 1. One idea per sentence.

Long sentences with many commas = harder to read. Split them.

## 2. Cut fillers.

Words like actually, really, just, kind of, basically often add no meaning.

- **Example:** "It is actually really important" → "It is important."

## 3. Prefer strong verbs over weak verbs + extra words.

- **Example:** "Make an improvement" → "Improve."
- **Example:** "Give an explanation" → "Explain."

## 4. Avoid repeating the same idea.

- **Example:** "End result" → "Result." Example: "Close proximity" →
  "Proximity."

## 5. Choose precise words.

- **Example:** "Go in a quick way" → "Rush."
