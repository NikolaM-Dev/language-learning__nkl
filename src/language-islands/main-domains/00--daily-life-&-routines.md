# Daily Life & Routines

## Question

What is the very first thing you usually do when you wake up?

## Answer

The very first thing I usually do when I wake up is grab my iPad and phone from
my bed. Then I place them on the dresser next to my desk, make my bed, and start
my Pomodoro timer. After that, I begin my morning routine by reviewing my agenda
in an app called TickTick.

## Question

How do you usually feel in the morning, and why?

## Answer

I usually feel really good in the morning, and I think that starts the night
before. About an hour before going to bed, I prepare for sleep. I turn off all
my screens, do some meditation, and practice sciatica exercises. Then I try to
relax and clear my mind. If something pops into my head, I just write it down in
my agenda and let my system take care of it so I can forget about it.

That routine helps me sleep well. I don't have bad dreams, and because I stop
drinking water after 6 p.m., I don't have to wake up in the middle of the night.
Most of the time, I can sleep straight through until the next day.

Of course, sometimes I break my habits. Nobody is perfect. Every now and then I
make bad decisions, like staying up too late, watching something on my iPad, or
chasing a “shiny object” idea that distracts me. When that happens, I don't
always follow my own rule of writing things down in my agenda.

## Question

What time do you normally wake up during the week?

## Answer

I usually wake up at 6:45 a.m. every day, whether it's a workday or the weekend.
That schedule works for me because it helps me stick to the same routine. It's
much easier to maintain in the long run since I don't have to worry about
changing my schedule or messing with my internal clock. I just keep it
consistent, and it works well for me.

## Question

What do you usually eat for breakfast, and how does it affect your day?

## Answer

For breakfast, I usually have eggs with arepa and hot chocolate. Sometimes I eat
caldo de huevo blanqueado, and once in a while I have calentado or something
different.

How does it affect my day? Honestly, it's the perfect balance. Around 10 a.m., I
recharge with a snack and some water, which helps me stay energized and perform
well until lunch.

## Question

How do you usually commute or get to the places you need to go?

## Answer

Tolima. The urban area is medium-sized for a town, but I can literally walk
Actually, I don't need to commute because I live in a small town called Fresno,
anywhere in less than 15 minutes.

So, most of the time I just walk everywhere. Sometimes my dad gives me a ride on
his motorcycle, or I take a taxi when I need to carry things.

## Question

What part of your morning routine do you enjoy the most?

## Answer

The part of my morning routine I enjoy the most is when I can actually focus on
doing deep work. At the start of my routine, I take care of basic things: I
clean myself up, take a shower, make my bed, wash the dishes, and feed my cat.
After that, I have breakfast, and then I dive into deep work until lunchtime. I
always feel eager to start working on my goals.

## Question

What's one thing you wish you could change about your mornings?

## Answer

Right now, I don’t think I want to change anything about my mornings. I’ve been
working on my morning routine for a long time, and this is the result of that
effort. Of course, there’s always room for improvement, but at the moment I
don’t really know what I could improve.

I’m constantly making small adjustments to optimize my time, batch tasks, and
make things easier and less mentally taxing. But overall, I wouldn’t change
anything, at least not right now. Maybe in the future, if my job changes or my
situation is different, I’ll need to adjust my routine and prioritize other
things. At that point, I might have a better answer.

## Question

How do you decide what clothes to wear each day?

## Answer

I made that decision a long time ago. I have plenty of clothes to choose from,
but these days I just follow the approach Steve Jobs used: I created my own kind
of uniform.

Since it’s really hot where I live most of the time, my uniform is simple:
Crocs, tall socks, shorts, and a white t-shirt. If I need to go out and the sun
is strong, I wear a cap to protect my face from the sunlight.

## Question

How do you usually take breaks during the day?

## Answer

I’ve developed a modified system based on the Pomodoro technique, but with some
extra steps. First, I work for one hour, staying deeply focused on whatever I’m
doing that day. After that hour, I take a 3-minute deep pause. Then, I spend 10
minutes looking into the distance to rest my eyes from the computer screen.
After that, I go back to work and repeat the process. By the way, I forgot to
mention that at the start of each work session, I spend a couple of minutes
standing up to make sure I alternate between sitting and standing.
