## Attempt 1

**Score:** 6.5

I'm learning new things from the Deep English blog to pratice my communications
skills in English.

The first story I stumbled upon was about an interisting surgery to cut part of
the tissue behind the tongue in Korea to help to the children that aparently had
troubles speaking and pronouncing the language properly for their short tongue.

So with this surgery named frenectomies kids would be able to speak clearly
since the tissue become more flexible and free to produce English sounds.

According to the author and my own experience learning language, this it's a
miss conception and the way get adquire the ability to produce sounds that
doesn't exists in your native language is with pratice focusing on pay attention
to these new sounds and try to imitate them.

He (the author) also expose that Koreans born in America didn't have troubles
because of their tongue. This also reminds me that humans usually want one magic
solution to their problems and avoid tackeling the real cause.

## Attempt 2

I'm learning new things from the Deep English blog to practice my communication
skills.

The first story I heard was about an interesting surgery called frenectomies.
It's a surgery to remove part of the tissue under the tongue with the propose of
make easy for kids to produce and pronounce English sounds.

But according to the author and my own experience learning languages, this
problem isn't about your tongue is about to be exposure to your target language
focus on trying to hear the new sounds that doesn't exists in your native
language.

He (the author) also adds that native Koreans born in America doesn't have this
problem at all.

It's funny that humans usually want a magic solution to their problems avoiding
the real solution because is easier or simple to believe on that.
