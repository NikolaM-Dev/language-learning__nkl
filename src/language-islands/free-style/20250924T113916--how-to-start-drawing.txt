 okay I just watched the video about how to start drawing in this video the
 creator explains what is the path he would like to choose if we start from
 scratch she is very concise very has a style
 freestyle of how to structure your journey don't be too rigid and also have
 fun because if you don't have fun it's difficult that that sticks for you okay
 starring he describes that you don't need to be worried about your age or
 how early you have to be you should start important thing here is
 start man who cares how old are you skills can be learned in whatever age
 it doesn't matter and I'm totally I'm totally agree with that mindset is
 useless to start thinking about oh I should do that oh I know I just be so
 perfect I know right now I should have these levels if I was starting the
 right time no man there is no right time the important thing is your star
 focus doing things may deliberate practice and you will you will get and
 you will get it is that it's just that's it's just that easy don't
 bother you don't then over complex things is so easy okay so first he
 just him could see first to start drawing you should according to the
 creator you should be three things do you like to oh no no no no before
 that the creators place that you can use whatever you have in your hands
 and a mano in your hands for start drawing you can use paper and then
 you can use an iPad and digital board or whatever or some recycled paper do
 you have your hand there in your home and you are going to trash it it's
 okay whatever in whatever you can draw the important thing is draw is drawing
 okay fine with the explication about the the age and the materials the most
 important now is start to practice and practice a lot important thing here
 is make a habit and draw constantly to improve your skills and the first
 milestone you need to achieve is be comfortable drawing without any
 hesitation and you feel that you don't have limits you have feel you feel
 free and you no matter what you can express your ideas of dust obviously
 there's a you are going to tackle with some learning curves and you are
 going to find obstacles but this totally fine and the more important
 thing again is a stick stick with that practice every day be constant okay
 starting you need to pick three things you want to draw you are going
 to draw each of you each of one each of that each of those things one
 per day when you have that you are being very curious about what are you
 drawing how your lines were the shapes were the forms etc etc you are going
 to do your best obviously it's going to be horrible and you are be a
 deception out by the way you by the way that it resolves but it's
 totally okay nobody is perfect at the start now you are going out of also
 also the creator describes that you need to pick interesting things that
 you find curious Wow that's amazing not something boring like your phone
 man you can find another things you need to know say one special one thing
 you find dressed in whatever you like then when you finish the draw and see
 your work draw it square around there around your your drawing and then
 start to making lines circles waved lines and also where various forms this
 is because you need to be comfortable with the essentials with the
 fundamentals you can also practice this by drawing they'll drawing these
 fundamentals isolated but it's going to be so boring that you are going to
 lose interest and when you lose interest in the wars because you you
 start to making a new habit of abandoning your your journey your
 journey about drawing okay with that in mind you are going to have three
 be three three new drawings at the third day in this moment you are going
 to jump into the second phase
 in this phase the outer and the outer in this the important for in
 this phase important thing here is to start copying things start getting
 inspiration search for things you want to draw about your favorite artists
 see how are doing that and you are going to do your best for try to copy
 what you are seeing you are in use seven to you are going to draw
 you're going to draw seven to ten ten ten things and again you are going to
 use you're going to use the fundamentals with this square there
 with the square around you find the square around the the dry you did
 draw you draw and you are going to incorporate more fundamentals you are
 going to start working with squared circles corners parameters etc etc we
 doesn't mind you need to structure you need to start thinking in how you
 can use that fundamentals in 3d to shape your your draws because at the
 end of the day everything you see you can structure in basic forms in this
 basic forms going to have you such an advantage because you are
 going to break down complex complex draw and simple forms and you are
 going to see a clear path to to reach that left okay we doesn't mind it's
 finally the step to start working the start you are going to choose one style
 you want to to stick also you can the test all three styles and try to
 and see what what you like more or what are your interests if you don't have
 a choice already okay you have three styles you have the academic the
 stylized and the finance first the academic is when you focus really hard
 on realist we are going to draw things as much as realist as we know we know
 here the out the creator of the video recommends three channels three or
 four channels to get inspirations see tutorials and may make the things more
 easy this is something that is going to the creator is going to repeat for
 every for that to follow in styles the second cell is stylized this is kind
 of like animation anime American anime American animation more West animation
 wherever be animated this the outer again she gives us some some YouTube
 channels to get inspirations see what I how to improve and finally the fun is
 with this this style you can see in in books for kids or this this that
 don't follow too much structure or too much structure is more free as more
 freedom the people who choose this is up and I'm making books because the
 cell is more free you don't have to worry about certain shapes structures
 etc etc so this is what you need now you can have all these steps then the
 next what do you need to focus now is keep going and going and going
 repeating repeating repeating repeating is the key repetition is the key for
 everything you have you try more than when you try more you are going to get
 better results again you are going to be uncomfortable some of time you are
 going to compare with others but the important thing is just compare with
 yourself try to master whatever skill you want to focus and keep going with
 deliberate practice and eventually you are going to be at the level you want
 off and of course this is your first draw you are going to become an
 artist that's all you need to become an artist
