## Attempt 1

**Score:** 7

If you would like to be more fluent in your target language you should spend a
lot of time reading material you can actually understand, at least 50%.
Otherwise, you are wasting your time since you aren't learning anything or
almost anything.

For that reason, extensive reading should be applied using graded books
according to your level, but don't pick something that feels easy and smoothly
because that also means you won't learn anything or almost anything.

A good tip to practice using extensive reading is don't look up for words you
don't know, just try your best to infer what could be the meaning according to
the context. Eventually with tons of exposition to that and others patterns you
will notice how this patterns start to speak by themselves when you try to use
them.

You could find graded books from Penguin Readers, Cambridge University, and
Oxford University websites.
