successful rate is 25%, meaning that 75% of participants have to quit for their
own will or for some injure. The tests are not just about to judge the physical
condition, but the mental.

For that reason, the Navy Seal school has founded that teaching the following
techniques increase the successful rate from 25% to 33%.

1. Goal setting, Navy Seals training are taught with the mindset of setting
   goals not only for the long term (Finish the 2 weeks course), but short and
   medium range goals, specially thinking on survive every daily challenge.
2. Mental Rehearsal, they are taught to visualize them not just only succeeding,
   but seen themselves reviewing and conquering every challenge from start to
   end.
3. Self-Talk, is a technique to take advantage from the fact that we are able to
   say over 700 words per minute in our minds. So, they are trained to transform
   every negative thought into a positive one even in the worst cases where they
   are at limit.
4. Arousal Control, to overcome the negative effects that stress makes when
