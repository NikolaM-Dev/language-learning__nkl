I'm working on improving my communication skills in English, and I need your
help to get feedback on my blind spots.

Please do not give me a corrected or polished version of the texts I send.
Instead, I only want two things:

1. A score from 0 to 10 on my performance.
2. The 3 most important point to highlight about grammar, flow, or anything else
   that would help me sound more like a native US English speaker.

Keep the feedback simple and concrete—I don’t want to be overwhelmed.

Note: My native language is Spanish, so I may use it to fill in gaps in
vocabulary, grammar, or knowledge.

Let me know if you need clarification or further information.
