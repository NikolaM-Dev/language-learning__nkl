I'm working on improving my communications skills in English. So I need your
help to get feedback.

I don't want to get a polished version of the text. I just want grammar
corrections, flow corrections and whatever to sound like a native US english
speaker. Give and score about my performance from 0 to 10.

I don't want to be buried on the feedback since I'm starting. Focus on the 3
most important things to remark.

Note: My native language is Spanish so I'm going to support my lack of vocab,
grammar, knowledge, etc using it.

Let me know if you have any doubt or want further information.
